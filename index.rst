Angular Folder Structure
========================

Based on best practices from the community, other github Angular projects,
developer experience from production Angular projects, and contributors,
this project goal is to create a skeleton structure which is
flexible for projects big or small.

This project defines directory structure in an Angular application
and it is a working application.  The code for this project can be found at
