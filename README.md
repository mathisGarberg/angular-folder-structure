Angular Folder Structure - Highly Scalable
========================================

![docs badge](https://readthedocs.org/projects/angular-folder-structure/badge/?version=latest)

This project is inspired by the article on ITNEXT called
"[How to define a highly scalable folder structure for your Angular project](https://itnext.io/choosing-a-highly-scalable-folder-structure-in-angular-d987de65ec7)"
by Mathis Garberg. Based on best practices from the community, other github
Angular projects, developer experience from production Angular projects, and
contributors to this repository, this project's goal is to *create a skeleton
structure which is flexible for projects big or small*.
